your tera lovei river sad and happness forerver legien
river flies by themselves
finally i can live alone,you disapper slowly,tell me everyhting,you are my all
finally i can forget ever not miss anymore
to let someone here,we can dance here
winds fly to ocean,who is still listean the weather,rain stops and who is still listen the 
who can only left,wait for the wind,back to the tree, to the outside of oceam
the future without you,i cant image,who remembers,your hand is warm as ever
who leave the ,only left alone,waiting for the wind,you think birds
